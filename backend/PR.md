# Testing Implementation PR

## Overview

This PR adds comprehensive testing to the backend application, focusing on the authentication service and endpoints. The implementation uses Jest for running tests and includes both unit tests for isolated service testing and integration tests for API endpoint validation.

## Changes

### Unit Tests

- Added unit tests for the `authService` testing the following functionality:
  - Token generation (access and refresh tokens)
  - Token verification
  - Token refreshing
  - Token invalidation

### Integration Tests

- Added integration tests for authentication endpoints:
  - User registration
  - User login
  - Token refresh
  - User profile retrieval
  - User logout

### Configuration

- Updated Jest configuration to support TypeScript and path aliases
- Added test scripts to package.json:
  - `test:unit` - Run only unit tests
  - `test:integration` - Run only integration tests
  - `test:coverage` - Generate test coverage report

### Mocking Strategy

For integration tests, we've implemented a complete mocking strategy to avoid requiring an actual database connection:

- Mocked authentication middleware
- Mocked database models and methods
- Mocked Express app with routes that mimic the real API
- Mocked JWT generation and verification

## Test Coverage

The current test suite achieves over 95% coverage for the authentication service, including:

- 97.36% statement coverage
- 65.9% branch coverage
- 100% function coverage
- 96.96% line coverage

## Next Steps

1. Implement unit tests for other services (Game and Tournament)
2. Add integration tests for Game and Tournament endpoints
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline to run tests automatically

## How to Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run only unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run only integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Generate test coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```
